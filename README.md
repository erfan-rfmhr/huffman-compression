============================================================================

This project allows users to compress and decompress text files with the Huffman Tree algorithm. It also has a graphical user interface for getting easier access to text files and compression/decompression operations.

Main Features
-------------

*   Read any text and/or compressed files from your computer
*   Compress text files with the Huffman Tree algorithm
*   Decompress compressed files created with the Huffman Tree algorithm

Usage
-----

Using the app is simple. First run main.py file. To open a text file and access its contents, simply click the open button and select the desired file. To compress or decompress a file, select the appropriate option and follow the instructions on the app.
